title: "Azure Family - Find your local user group"

Welcome to a listing of the Azure User Groups that are located around the world.  

This is an open source project, so if you are aware of a group that exists and isn't listed here, please look at contributing to the project and updating the list for others.  If you are unsure how to contribute, I've put together a small [how-to](/how-to) guide for you. 

Getting involved with your local user group has a great many benefits, from helping you learn something new from a speaker to making new connections amongst the other attendees.  There are a lot of different commnuities out there you can get involved in and this site is intended to help people find and participate in their Azure communities more easily.
