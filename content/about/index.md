This site was created as a way of helping others find a user group near them. [Sarah Lean](https://www.twitter.com/Techielass) created the [Glasgow Azure User Group](https://www.gaug.co.uk) after noticing there was only one other user group in the UK focussed on Azure and she wanted to help build the community.  

This site was created by her in order to help others find their local community and get involved.  This hope is this site will become a collaborative source for people trying to find a local user group.
