How to contribution guide

This is a collaborative list of Azure user groups that are setup around the world.  If you know of an Azure user group that isn't listed on this website, you can help to contribute to it in one of two days. 

## Create an Issue

Head over to the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/weeyin83/azureusergroup/issues) and create a new issue with details of the user group or details correcting an existing user group which is on the list. 

## Update the listing

Head on over to the [website source code](https://github.com/weeyin83/azureusergroup), which is hosted on GitHub.  Fork the repository so you have a copy of the source files you can edit. 

Within the /content/post folder you will find folders for reach of the regions around the world.  Inside each of these folders is an index.md which stores the information that lists each user group. Add the user group details into the correct folder/file.  Once you have made the necessary changes do a Pull Request back into the [original](https://github.com/weeyin83/azureusergroup) repository.  

Once the pull request has been checked over and everything is okay it will be made live the website. 

## New Country/Region Page

If you think another page should be created please feel free to create it under /content/post and then create an index.md file. 

The config.toml file at the root of the source code should also be modified to update the navigation menu. 

## Design changes

Please feel free to make design changes and suggestions, this is very much iteration one, suggestions are welcomed. :)
