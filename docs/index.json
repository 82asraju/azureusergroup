If you are unsure how to contribute, I\u0026rsquo;ve put together a small how-to guide for you.\nGetting involved with your local user group has a great many benefits, from helping you learn something new from a speaker to making new connections amongst the other attendees. There are a lot of different commnuities out there you can get involved in and this site is intended to help people find and participate in their Azure communities more easily.\n"

	"content": "This site was created as a way of helping others find a user group near them. Sarah Lean created the Glasgow Azure User Group after noticing there was only one other user group in the UK focussed on Azure and she wanted to help build the community. This site was created by her in order to help others find their local community and get involved. This hope is this site will become a collaborative source for people trying to find a local user group.\n"
